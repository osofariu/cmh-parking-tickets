* To Do
- remove duplicate CSV file, and encrypt the one I am using for meters
- Use Pipeline explicitly for all transformations
- Create unit tests for each transformation step
- Save the notebook as a readable markdown format so that diff's make sense. This is just
  a good practices I should be adopting.
- Any way to cache this: ox.graph_from_place('Columbus, Ohio, USA'..) so it doesn't have
  to grab this every time from remote location?
